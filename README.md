* **User Authentication**: Secure login for teachers to manage their own classrooms and student data.
* **Classroom Management**: Teachers can create, view, and delete classrooms, each with a name, subject, and description.

* **Attendance History**: View a detailed history of all past attendance records, grouped by session.
